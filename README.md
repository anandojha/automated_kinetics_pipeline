## Automated Simulation Pipeline for Kinetic and Thermodynamic Predictions

This repository provides an **end-to-end automated pipeline** for running **milestoning simulations** with machine-learned force fields to accelerate **drug-target kinetic and thermodynamic predictions**. The pipeline utilizes **SEEKR2**, **SEEKRTools**, and **espaloma=0.3.2** to automate simulations.

### **Getting Started**

To install and set up the necessary environment, run the following commands in sequence.

#### 1. Create a new conda environment named 'one_step_kinetics' with Python 3.10
The --yes flag ensures it installs without prompting for confirmation.
```sh
conda create -n one_step_kinetics python=3.10 --yes
```

#### 2. Activate the conda environment
Once the environment is created, activate the conda environment, switching the current shell session to use the new environment.
```sh
conda activate one_step_kinetics
```

#### 3. Install mamba for faster dependency resolution
Mamba is a faster drop-in replacement for conda that speeds up package installations.
```sh
conda install conda-forge::mamba --yes
```

#### 4. Install SEEKR2 plugin
This step installs OpenMM plugin for SEEKR2 package.
```sh
mamba install seekr2_openmm_plugin openmm=8.1 --yes
```
#### 5. Verify SEEKR2 OpenMM Plugin Installation
Run the following command to check if the SEEKR2 OpenMM plugin is correctly installed. If no error message appears, the installation was successful.
```sh
python -c "import seekr2plugin"
```

#### 6. Install Git
Git is required to clone repositories. Ensure it is installed using:

```sh
conda install conda-forge::git --yes
```

#### 7. Before proceeding, go to the home directory (recommended).
```sh
cd ~
```

#### 8. Now, clone the SEEKR2 repository, install it, and run tests to verify the installation.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/seekrcentral/seekr2.git
cd seekr2
python -m pip install .
pytest 
cd ~
```

#### 9. 


```sh

```

#### 10. 


```sh

```

#### 11. 


```sh

```

#### 12.
