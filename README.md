# Automated Simulation Pipeline for Kinetic and Thermodynamic Predictions

This repository provides an **end-to-end automated pipeline** for running **milestoning simulations** with machine-learned force fields to accelerate **drug-target kinetic and thermodynamic predictions**. The pipeline utilizes **SEEKR2**, **SEEKRTools**, and **espaloma=0.3.2** to automate simulations.

## **Getting Started**

To install and set up the necessary environment, run the following commands in sequence.

#### 1. Create a new conda environment named 'one_step_kinetics' with Python 3.10
The --yes flag ensures it installs without prompting for confirmation.
```sh
conda create -n one_step_kinetics python=3.10 --yes
```

#### 2. Activate the conda environment
Once the environment is created, activate the conda environment, switching the current shell session to use the new environment.
```sh
conda activate one_step_kinetics
```

#### 3. Install mamba for faster dependency resolution
Mamba is a faster drop-in replacement for conda that speeds up package installations.
```sh
conda install conda-forge::mamba --yes
```

#### 4. Before proceeding, go to the home directory (recommended)
```sh
cd ~
```

#### 5. Install SEEKR2 plugin
This step installs OpenMM plugin for SEEKR2 package.
```sh
mamba install seekr2_openmm_plugin openmm=8.1 --yes
```
