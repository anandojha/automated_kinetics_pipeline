# Automated Simulation Pipeline for Kinetic and Thermodynamic Predictions

This repository provides an **end-to-end automated pipeline** for running **milestoning simulations** with machine-learned force fields.

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Install Dependencies**

Before installing **SEEKR2** and **SEEKRTools**, ensure you have **Conda** installed. The following commands will set up the required environment and install dependencies.

#### **Step 1: Create and Activate Conda Environment**
```sh
conda create -n one_step_kinetics python=3.10 --yes
conda activate one_step_kinetics
